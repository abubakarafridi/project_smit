// Let's talk a little more about ===. It's a type of comparison operator, specifically an equality operator.

// you use it to compare two things to see if they're equal.

// You can use the equality operator to compare a variable with a string, a variable with a
// number, a variable with a math expression, or a variable with a variable. And you can use it to
// compare various combinations.

// if (fullName === "Mark" + " " + "Myers")
// if (fullName === firstName + " " + "Myers")
// if (fullName === firstName + " " + "Myers")
// if (fullName === "firstName + " " + lastName)
// if (totalCost === 81.50 + 135)
// if (totalCost === materialsCost + 135)
// if (totalCost === materialsCost + laborCost)
// if (x + y === a - b)

// Another comparison operator, !==, is the opposite of ===. It means is not equal to.

// let yourTicketNumber = prompt("enter you ticket number");
// if (yourTicketNumber !== 487208) {
//   alert("Better luck next time.");
// }

// Like ===, the not-equal operator can be used to compare numbers, strings, variables, math
// expressions, and combinations.
// Like ===, string comparisons using the not-equal operator are case-sensitive. It's true that
// "Rose" !== "rose".

// Here are 4 more comparison operators, usually used to compare numbers.
// > is greater than
// < is less than
// >= is greater than or equal to
// <= is less than or equal to

// if(1 > 0)
// if(0 < 1)
// if(1 >= 0)
// if(1 >= 1)
// if(0 <= 1)
// if(1 <= 1)

// Just as the double equal sign can usually be used instead of the triple equal sign, != can
// usually be used instead of !==. In the exercises, I'll ask you to stick to !==.
