// An if statement always begins with if

// Following the if keyword-plus-space is the condition that's being testedâ€”does the
// variable that's been assigned the user's response have a value of "kaaba"?
// The condition is enclosed in parentheses.
// If the condition tests true, something happens. Any number of statements might execute. In
// this case, only one statement executes: a congratulatory alert displays.

// The first line of an if statement ends with an opening curly bracket. An entire if statement
// ends with a closing curly bracket on its own line. Note that this is an exception to the rule that
// a statement ends with a semicolon. It's common to omit the semicolon when it's a complex
// statement that's paragraph-like and ends in a curly bracket.

// But what about that triple equal sign? You might think that it should just be an equal sign,
// but the equal sign is reserved for assigning a value to a variable. If you're testing a variable
// for a value, you can't use the single equal sign.


// var x = prompt("Where does the imam live?");
// if (x === "kaaba") {
// alert("Correct!");
// }
