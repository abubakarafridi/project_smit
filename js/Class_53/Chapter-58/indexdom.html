      // getElementById, getElementByTagName These methods have limitations
      // getElementById has access to those components that has been assigned and id
      // getElementByTagName has access to all the tag that is mention and not a specific one thing
      // These two are many of the methods to work with Document Object Model(DOM).
      // The DOM is a chart created by the browser automatically whey your web page loads.
      // All the things on you web page , tha tags , links, style attribute and more have a spot in the chart.
      // JavaScript can get it hands on anything on the page.
      // It can add things, move, delete, manipulate the chart.
      // The three top levels of DOM are always the same for a standard web page.
      // document is first, second is html, there are two three levels head and body.
      // under those are more levels
