      // Fundamental way of designating nodes to DOM.
      // You can designate any node of DOM by saying the node is xth child of a particular parent.
      // You can designame a node by saying it's the parent of any child.
      // Except document node each node is enclosed in another node.
      // html encloses the head and body node, body encloses div node.
      // div enloses two p node
      // both p node encloses text node inside.
      // When a node is enclosed by another node the encloased node is called the parent.
      // div is the child of body and also body is the parent of div.
      // html is the child of document, head and body are the children of html, div is the child of body.
      // two p's are the children of div.
      // So we can also say that document is the parent of html, html is the parent of head and body.
      // head is the parent of title, title is the parent of text node.
      // Nodes with the same parent are known as siblings.
