// VARIABLE NAMES LEGAL AND ILLEGAL

// A variable name can't contain any spaces

// A variable name can contain only letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores.

// Though a variable name can't be any of JavaScript's keywords, it can contain keywords.
// For example, userAlert and myVar are legal.

// Capital letters are fine, but be careful. Variable names are case sensitive. A rose is not a
// Rose. If you assign the string "Floribundas" to the variable rose, and then ask JavaScript
// for the value assigned to Rose, you'll come up empty.
