// A good website is a responsive website.
// If a user do something he gets a response.
// like if he press a button he get a response, press a key, move a mouse.
// JavaScript gives you ways to respond to the user response.

// A few Example:
// A page with a "Before" picture of a model and when mouse is over the picture it is replaced with an "After" picture of her.

// The user has entered her email address in a form, when he want to fill the next form javascript checks if the email he entered
// is correct or not. If she didn't writes ".com" in it a message appared that she entered her email incorrect.

// In online shopping if something with a color option is there if the user selets that color the picture changes to that
// Color of the product.

// Clicking button, moving the mouse, moving from one field to another
// is all javascript events. Javascript code that respondes to those events is called as event handler.

// The oldest and most strightforward approach to event handling is inline event-handling.
// When you are writing production code, this is not the best way to handle events which is the same as with CSS.
