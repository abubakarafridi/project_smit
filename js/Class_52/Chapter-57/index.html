    <!-- In the last chapter you learned how to make a collection of array of all the element in a document
        that have a particular tag name -->
    <script>
        // pars is assigned a collection of paragrapht
        var pars = document.getElementsByTagName("p");

        // This statement gets the element at a particular index and assigns it to a variable
        var textInMiddleParagraph = pars[1].innerHTML;

        // Suppose you want some of the element of the tag
        var e = document.getElementsById("rules");
        var paragraph = e.getElementsById("p");
        // here is the code for geting some to the element of the tag name

        // line 19 "e" is assigned Id rules
        // line 20 paragraph is assigned all the p element in that div which has id rules

        // Suppose you have a table with a white background when user clicks it turns pink
        let t = document.getElementById("table9");
        let cells = t.getElementsByTagName("td");
        for (let i = 0; i < cells.length; i++) {
            cells[i].style.backgroundColor = "pink";
        }

        // here is how it works
        // 1. Targets the table with id 
        // 2. td collection is assigned to cells
        // 3-5. loops through all of them to change the background color
