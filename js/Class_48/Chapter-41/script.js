// For loop iteration

// for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
//     alert(i);
// }

// The process is controled by three process
// - var i = 0 declared and initialize counter.
// - i < 10 is a condition it should run till 9 times the loop will run 10 times.
// - i++ everytime the condition is true the i get incremented be 1.

// All the how-to-loop directions are packed into the space between the parentheses: 
// where to start the counter, how long to keep the loop going, and how to update the counter each time through.

// A while loop does the same thing but a little different.
// The counter is initialize before the while loop.
// The Condition is inside the parentheses which is the only thing inside parentheses
// counter is incremented inside the while loop block

var i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    alert(i);
    i++;
