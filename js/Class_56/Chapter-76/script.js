// In addition to making things happen on the webpage, you can use JavaScript to control the
// browser. To begin with, you can get the browser to tell you its current location.

// var whereWeAt = window.location.href;
// console.log(whereWeAt);

// This statement gets just the domain name.
// var domain = window.location.hostname;
// console.log(domain);

// Here's how you get the path.
// let path = window.location.pathname
// console.log(path);

// This statement identifies the anchor
// var theAnchor = window.location.hash;
// console.log(theAnchor);

// As usual, you can reverse the order of things, telling the browser where to go instead of asking where it is.
// window.location.href = "http://www.me.com/1.html";
// The statement above tells the browser to navigate to the page named 1.html at the site me.com.
