    <!-- Note that even though the onsubmit button is not in the submit button tag but in form tag -->
    <!-- It is because that the onsubmit is applies on the whole form -->

    <!-- Here where it gets intersting when the form is submitted the function checkAddress looks for anything entered in the email tag -->
    <!-- If there is noting an alert reminding that the email is required -->

    <!-- In order to look for anything in the email field an id is used for that -->
