// The placement of JavaScript code in HTML can affect the loading speed of the webpage.
// Generally, it's recommended to place JavaScript code at the end of the body section to ensure CSS styling and image display aren't blocked by loading scripts.

// JavaScript code can be either embedded in the HTML file using `<script>` tags or placed in a separate JavaScript file with the extension `.js`.
// Including a separate JavaScript file is recommended for better code organization and maintainability.
